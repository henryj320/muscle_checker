# muscle_checker
This is a repository for my Muscle Checker project. Input which exercises you completed this week. The system outputs which of the main muscles you missed this week and what exercises you could do to train them. In the future, this could be updated to also conain an image of the muscles hit and missed, just like on Garmin workouts.
